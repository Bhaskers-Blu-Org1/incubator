# Submitting a new tech talk

* Tech talks can be submitted via a new [issue](https://github.com/IBM/incubator/issues/new)

Include details such as:
* Your tech talk idea, and what blog, how-to or Pattern it's based on
* Will you be giving the tech talk? If not, are you requesting that we find a speaker for the talk?
* Additional support is necessary to answer questions in the chat for a tech talk, do you have access to resources?
* Apply the [tech-talk](https://github.com/IBM/incubator/labels/tech-talk) label to your issue.

Before an idea is approved, think about it from the following aspect:
* Does the subject matter lend itself well to a tech talk?
* What is it's advocacy potential?
* Is the pattern or blog the talk is based on free to run?
* Is there code to be written? Will there be a live-demo?
* Are we inheriting code?
* What is it's priority?
* Is it for a product or release launch?
* Does this tech-talk fill a gap in our portfolio?
* Does it overlap with our existing portfolio?
* Can we partner up with a client?
* Does this tech-talk highlight an IBM product advantage vs market products

## Reviewing pull requests

A note to tech-talk developers: The expectation for each talk is that once the initial set of code has been checked in we expect pull-requests to be used exclusively and authors do not self merge content.
